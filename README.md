# reimagined-journey

Hello and welcome to our first project! 

Do you have a pet ? Even if you don't you know how crazy people are about their pets! This app is for those people. wether your traveling, on the go, or just need last minute supplies this app will help you make sure your furry friend is always taken care of.

In this project we built a website that when a user inputs their location (city,state at minimum) then our website would respond by opening a map and showing markers at the nearest pet stores! 

In future working we would like to add the options of gps directioning so when a user does see pet stores near them, instead of having to leave the page for directions, they'll be able to get redirected straight from our page.
